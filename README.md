mc_rtc Collision Monitoring Birjandi plugin
==

This project is a [mc_rtc] plugin implementing the **Observer-Extended Direct Method** for collision monitoring in robot manipulators using **proprioception and a single IMU sensor**.

This implementation follows the methodology described in the paper:

Observer-Extended Direct Method for Collision Monitoring in Robot Manipulators Using Proprioception and IMU Sensing.

It has been implemented and tested on the **Kinova robotic arm**, with an **IMU mounted on the last joint** to detect collisions at the **end effector**, just like in the experiment described in the paper.
